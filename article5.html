<p>THE onion and potatoes value chain stakeholders have resolved that the country does not need to import the commodities as the country has adequate stocks.</p>

<p>Zambia National Farmers Union president Jervis Zimba has told Mwebantu in a statement.</p>

<p>Mr Zimba said during a protracted meeting by onion and potatoes stakeholders, including traders, processors and producers organised by the union held at the ZNFU secretariat resolved that there shall be no imports of the stocks or frozen onion related products as the country has enough stocks.</p>

<p>“And furthermore that there is no need for imports of potatoes as the country has adequate stocks from the carryovers and fresh stocks. There is no need for imports of frozen chips,” he said.</p>

<p>Mr Zimba further said there is no need for imports of potato chips and importers of potato crisps shall be referred to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry for further advice as stakeholders are only in support of measures that will lead to increased production of potatoes locally and value addition.</p>

<p>He said stakeholders have also agreed to be in constant consultation to avail updates on commodity availability and measures to be taken.</p>
