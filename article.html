            <p>
              Many of us believe we can kill the bacteria in our food,
              especially meat, by simply cooking. But University of Zambia
              Professor of Veterinary Public Health and Wildlife Medicine, Dr.
              Musso Munyeme, has revealed that there are a number of survivalist
              bacterial pathogens that are very resistant even to extreme
              temperatures.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dr. Munyeme disclosed this during a Facebook Live Chat on the Link
              Between Zoonotic Diseases and Illegal Bushmeat hosted by Wildlife
              Crime Prevention. He explained that these survivalist bacterial
              species usually form spores which are able to survive freezing or
              boiling temperatures, waiting for the right conditions to bloom
              into deadly bacteria.
            </p>

            <p>
              One such spore-forming bacterium that Dr. Munyeme highlighted is
              anthrax. He said, “The bacterium that causes anthrax forms spores
              when exposed to air and these spores are extremely resistant to
              environmental conditions and have been shown to survive in the
              soil for over 60 years.” For example, it was discovered that an
              outbreak of anthrax in Siberia, Russia in 2016, which sickened at
              least 13 people and killed over 2,000 reindeer (a species of
              deer), resulted when a reindeer that died of anthrax 75 years
              earlier was unburied by melting ice.
            </p>

            <p>
              During the chat, Dr. Munyeme further disclosed that the anthrax
              bacterium not only survives in hot temperatures but that it
              actually needs them for it to become active. “When we want to
              culture it [anthrax bacterium] in the lab, we first have to boil
              it in order to excite it to grow and become active”, he added.
            </p>

            <p>
              The implication of this revelation is that our long held view that
              we can kill all bacteria by simply cooking our food may not be
              entirely correct. “With certain bacteria you could actually do
              more harm than good by boiling them because when you heat or boil
              certain bacteria, you make them more virulent.” This means when
              the bacterium is ingested by humans, it multiplies rapidly, with
              extremely severe or harmful effects because heating made the
              bacterium more active.
            </p>

            <p>
              This also puts into question another long held view, common
              especially among consumers of bushmeat, that dried bushmeat is
              safer because pathogens are killed during the process of drying.
              In reality, the revelation made by Dr. Munyeme on anthrax clearly
              shows that if bacteria can withstand boiling, they definitely
              cannot be harmed by sun-drying, the process used to dry illegal
              bushmeat.
            </p>

            <p>
              Humans and animals can ingest anthrax from carcasses of dead
              animals that have been contaminated with anthrax. Ingestion of
              anthrax can cause serious, sometimes fatal disease. He also
              revealed that 96 percent of all zoonotic diseases are believed to
              be foodborne, meaning they result from people consuming
              contaminated and infected animal meat.
            </p>

            <p>
              One of the ways that many Zambians are exposed to contaminated
              wildlife meat is through the illegal bushmeat trade. In Zambia,
              anthrax has been shown to be common in hippos, which are often
              exposed to anthrax spores as they search for food by rooting in
              the soil. When you consider the fact that hippo meat accounts for
              much of the illegal bushmeat being traded, the threat of a serious
              disease outbreak becomes real.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dr. Munyeme also touched on the dangerous role the illegal
              bushmeat trade plays in causing zoonotic disease outbreak. “A lot
              of the bushmeat people eat is actually illegal. The danger is when
              you consume something illegal you are not going trace its source,
              how it was prepared or how it was obtained, it might have been
              harvested from animals which died on their own, or from animals
              that were semi-decomposed in snares.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Poachers are always fearful of being spotted by someone or being
              caught by wildlife police officers. So, when they set snares in
              national parks and other protected areas, they often leave them
              unattended for days. As a result, a trapped animal can remain in
              the snare for days before its harvested and by that time, it would
              have already started decomposing.
            </p>

            <p>
              To give an idea of what I’m talking about, I have attached a
              picture showing a dead impala in a snare. The impala is also
              pregnant so by the time poachers come to harvest it, the animal
              and its calf would have already started decomposing. And since
              poachers have a nothing goes to waste policy, this rotting and
              likely bacterium-infested meat will still be sold to unsuspecting
              people. This obviously increases the risk of zoonotic diseases
              being transmitted to poachers themselves and to consumers of
              illegal bushmeat.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another issue that Dr. Munyeme raised during the Facebook live
              chat is the potential for the illegal bushmeat trade has the
              potential to diseases disease from areas where they are known to
              occur to wherever illegal bushmeat is consumed. For instance,
              while anthrax is a local disease that is known to occur in places
              with high populations of hippos like the Luangwa valley, when
              infected hippo meat is transported big cities like Lusaka and
              Ndola, the disease can be transmitted to those populated areas,
              where it may cause greater harm. During the 20011 anthrax outbreak
              that sickened over 500 people and caused more than 5 deaths,
              people travelled from far places like Copperbelt to harvest
              anthrax infected hippo carcasses in Chama. As a result, the
              outbreak was reported even in areas that are quiet far from Chama.
            </p>

            <p>
              In a nutshell, the illegal bushmeat trade is closely linked to
              outbreaks of zoonotic diseases. The illegal bushmeat that poachers
              sell often contains bacteria that are so resistant that even
              boiling will not kill some of them.
