            <p>Steven Mwansa is alleged to have defiled the victim after she was sent to charcoal at a nearby market.</p>
            
            <p>
              Copperbelt province acting police commanding officer Tresphord Kasale confirmed the incident in a statement.
            </p>
            <p>Mr Kasale said the incident happened yesterday around 09:00 hours in unfinished building along Independece road in Chililabombwe.</p>
            
            <p>He said the victim’s mother reported that her daughter,  aged 21, who is mentally retarded was allegedly defiled by a person only known as Steven Mwansa, aged 42 of house number E 320 PP Zambia Compound Chililabombwe.</p>
            
            <p>“She was caused to sustain painful private parts and general body pains. The incident occurred when the mentally retarded victim was sent by her mother to go buy charcoal and she took long in coming back.
