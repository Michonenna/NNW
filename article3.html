            In the search for sustainable economic development, commercial game farming has emerged as one of Zambia’s ‘new’ ventures and has shown immense potential to create sustainable employment thereby reducing poverty levels whilst also helping to conserve our precious wildlife species. Although not new at all, given the industry has been around for several decades, it is being seen through a new lens. Traditionally most Zambian game farms are side-lines to largescale commercial arable or cattle farms.  This is in great contrast to other countries in the region where game farming is booming. South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe have thriving industries that provide live animals and meat for sale.
            
            In a 2013 report for the Wildlife Producers Association of Zambia, Dr Peter Lindsey estimated that game ranching, crocodile farming and the game capture and trading industries have a combined turnover of approximately USD15.7 million per annum[1]. While that might sound like a lot, there is a lot more potential in Zambia for game ranching. The report also interesting stated that game ranching provided more income per kilogram of biomass than livestock farming. Further, game ranching allows for the utilization of marginal lands and provides a buffer against drought and climate change, something that Zambia is currently experiencing. Dr Lindsey found that ranchers who utilized wildlife in addition to crop farming and/or livestock farming boosted their income by an average of 23%.  Although more than 6 years have passed since this report was produced, the game industry is Zambia is still yet to fully take off.
            
            Game farming has immense potential for growth in Zambia. Zambia has a relatively small but highly urbanized population. This provides large tracts of underutilized land most of which is not suitable for livestock farming but ideal for game.  As climate change causes changes in temperature and rainfall patterns, many farmers are rethinking their agricultural practices.  Income from game ranching is predicted to be less affected by climate change than livestock farming and may thus provide a buffer for global negative climate change effects. Due to endemic foot-and-mouth-disease status, the export of beef and other livestock products to the European Union is challenging for Zambia, whilst focusing on an domestic game market in Zambia could potentially do away with the stringent and often expensive veterinary controls that limit wildlife-based land uses in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana.
            
            However, Zambia has not fully explored its game farming potential. According to Wildlife Producers Association of Zambia (WPAZ), only a small number of recreational game farms are scattered throughout the country. WPAZ’s Chairman Ian Robinson, explains that the revenues collected from the country’s game farms are so small they have no real meaning or significance. Meanwhile, South Africa’s commercial game farming industry generates more money from game farming than from agriculture, at over USD6 billion per annum.
            
            The biggest difference between Zambia and the countries that are making fortunes from game farming is that Zambia has been losing its wildlife to illegal, unsustainable and unregulated industries like poaching and the illegal bushmeat trade for years. As a result, Zambia is losing out on the social and economic benefits that it could otherwise realize from its wildlife resource for current and future generations.There are many ways in which Zambia can profit from a well-established and fully functional game farming industry.
            
            A Source of Legal Game Meat
            
            Knock on any door in Zambia and you will likely find someone who consumes game meat. Zambia has a significant market for game meat that is currently being provided for by bushmeat which is illegally and unsustainably sourced.  It is an undeniable fact that Zambians love game meat. It has always been an important part of the diets of many as it is thought to be tasty and has cultural connotations. This has created a high demand that has sadly only been met so far by a small supply of legal game meat. Ian Robinson revealed that Zambia’s game meat demand is 10 times the current legal supply.
            
            Taking advantage of this, ruthless poachers have created an illegal bushmeat industry that poses a serious threat to Zambia’s wildlife populations through unethical, unselective and unsustainable hunting methods such as snaring and poisoning. Due to the hunting methods and processing utilised, bushmeat is often not fit for consumption as people never really know what animal they are eating or under what conditions the meat was prepared. Diseases are often reported by consumers of illegal bushmeat. For example, an outbreak of Anthrax currently being experienced in the Lower Zambezi may well be contaminating illegal sources of bushmeat unknown to unsuspecting consumers.
            
            Game farming therefore poses an opportunity to create a supply of game meat, that is legal, fit for consumption and most importantly, sustainable. If properly marketed, legal game meat can quickly win the hearts of many, after all, Zambians rightly love a trusted source. To this effect, the Department of National Parks and Wildlife (DNPW) in collaboration with Wildlife Crime Prevention (WCP) is currently running a campaign dubbed This Is Not A Game, which is meant to sensitize the public on the dangers of illegal bushmeat as well as to point consumers to the right sources of legal game meat.
            
             
            
            A Sustainable way to create employment
            
            On average, the illegal bushmeat trade creates employment for only a few people, mainly the poachers and the illegal traders. All of whom put their freedom at risk every time they participate in illegal activities. It does not create employment for many people outside the supply chain nor does it provide long term sustainable income. Further, the illegal bushmeat industry is not regulated so neither the local communities nor the rest of the country benefit in any way. Ultimately it significantly reduces the chances of any Zambian benefitting from our vast natural resources.
            
            On the other hand, a fully functional game farm can create employment for over 150 people from the local community through farm workers, drivers, administrators, veterinary doctors and many other support staff. It can also provide the government with a sustainable income, through taxes, for the improvement of life in communities around game farms and the rest of the country. This is already happening in Zambia, where the few thriving game farms have created employment for local people and are helping local communities through monies given to Community Resource Boards. However, there is great potential for this to improve significantly. That will require a deliberate effort encourage the growth of the game farming industry.
            
            The Ministry of Tourism and Arts, through DNPW have made several public statements encouraging the growth of this industry and new policy reforms are hoped to support its further development. It is difficult to talk about game farming without talking about how one can become a game farmer in Zambia. Would be farmers can visit the DNPW offices in Chilanga for information on how to set up legal game parks as well as find out what game would be best to rear on the proposed farm land.
            
            In addition, How to start a game ranch[2], an article by The Ministry of Tourism and Arts Public Relations Officer Sakabilo Kalembwe, is also a good way to get an introduction to legal game farming as it discusses in depth the necessary procedure for starting a game farm in Zambia.
            
            In the meantime, next time you are offered bushmeat think twice about the impact you are really having on our country, our environment and your stomach. Be sure to ask to see a licence to ensure you are eating legal game meat to make sure you really know what’s on your plate.
